                    is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
                    for building user interfaces based on components. <br>It is
                    maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of
                    individual developers and companies.

                    React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or
                    server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.
                    because React is only concerned with the user interface and
                    rendering components to the DOM,<br> React applications often
                    rely on libraries for routing and other client-side
                    functionality.</p>
